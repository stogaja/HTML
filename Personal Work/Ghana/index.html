        <b>Did you know that</b> Ghanaian names (or Personal names in Ghana)
        consists of several given names and surnames based on the language of
        ethnic groups in Ghana including Akan. Frequently, children are given a
        "day name" which corresponds to the day in the week they were born.
        These day names have further meanings concerning the soul and character
        of the person. Middle names have considerably more variety and can refer
        to their birth order, twin status, or an ancestor's middle name. These
        names are also used among Ghanaians living abroad and among Africans
        living in the diaspora who wish to identify with their ancestral
        homeland. During the 18th-19th Century, the enslaved people from modern
        day Ghana in the Caribbean were referred to as Coromantees. Most day
        names among the Mole-Dagombas are usually given to the females and few
        are given to both sexes. <br />
        <br />
        This site however helps you know your Akan name.
